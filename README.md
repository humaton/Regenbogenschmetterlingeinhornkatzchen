# Regenbogenschmetterlingeinhornk√§tzchen

This is pre alpha software, its aim is to ease development with containers on exotic platforms like Windows or Mac.

CDK expects you to have installed vagrant,
if not you can do so [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads)

And downloaded boxes with following names:  
rhel-7.0, rhel-7.1-atomic, centos-server-7, centos-atomic-7
(box downloading will be part of this project soon)

##Installation

There are two ways how to install cdk

###From source
```bash
git clone git@github.com:humaton/regenbogenschmetterlingeinhornkatzchen.git
cd regenbogenschmetterlingeinhornkatzchen
gem build regenbogenschmetterlingeinhornkatzchen.gemspec
gem install regenbogenschmetterlingeinhornkatzchen-0.0.2.gem
```

###Rubygems
```bash
$gem install regenbogenschmetterlingeinhornkatzchen
```
##Usage

You will be asked couple of questions about your development setup. 
Followed by download and import of vagrant box.
